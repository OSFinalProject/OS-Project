people - name start end 'wait' 'arrival'
elevator - id low high current cap

reader thread will read all people coming in, clean the data, and store in struct, keep track of arrival time, store struct in a queue/file

pop first person from the queue/file and match it to an elevator 

for scheduler - edge cases: top floor and bottom floor

detects me waiting for elevator, grab my current floor, end floor

scheduler will check where all elevators (having capacity) are,
check where I want to go: up or down

if I want to go down, look at all elevators that are either above my level or at my level
 then check if the elevator original direction is also 'down' or 'stationary'
    if it is coming down - 
        loop and store the one which is closest to me

if I want to go up, look at all elevators that are either below my level or at my level
 then check if the elevator original direction is also 'up' or 'stationary'
    if it is coming up-
     loop store the one which is closest to me

update the elevator struct of the selected elevator

put the person on the selected elevator - (if person next in line at the current floor also wants to go in the same direction, put them on - loop)

elevator goes in the original direction till it reaches the top floor, then the direction is flipped
for every floor that the elevator will stop at - if people removed (update capacity), check if anyone is waiting and wants to go in the same direction, if yes put them on if we have capacity
when it reaches the top, everyone should have left the elevator and it should be empty - check this

loop

OS does this:

keeps track of who entered the elevator first

stop at the floor where the person who entered first wants to go
