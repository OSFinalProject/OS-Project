## Using Modified Round-Robin Scheduling
### Why Choose RR?
Several factors influenced the decision to adopt the RR algorithm for this project:

1. Grouping: This modified version of round-robin groups people together based on the direction they are going rather than scheduling individual people.

2. Checks for space: The implementation of this algorithm works to check the remaining capacity of the elevator before assigning anyone.

### Potential Improvements and Optimization
While RR is an effective scheduling algorithm, there are areas where further optimization and enhancements could be explored:

1. Group dependency: The efficiency of the group travel will be dependent on the trip of the first person selected.

### Conclusion 
In conclusion, despite the inherent pros and cons of the Modified RR scheduling algorithm, it remains a superior choice compared to the traditional round-robin scheduling algorithm.
