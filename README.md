## Using Shortest Process Next Scheduling
### Why Choose FCFS?
Several factors influenced the decision to adopt the FCFS algorithm for this project:

1. Fairness: FCFS ensures fairness by servicing elevator requests in the order they are received. This prevents any request from being indefinitely delayed, promoting equal access to elevator services for all users.
2. Simplicity: FCFS is straightforward to implement and understand. It does not require complex algorithms or data structures, making it easy to maintain and debug.
3. Low Overhead: The FCFS algorithm has low computational overhead since it only requires tracking the order of incoming requests and servicing them sequentially.
4. Predictable Behavior: Users can predict the behavior of the elevator system since requests are processed in a deterministic manner based on their arrival time.

### Potential Flaws
While FCFS is an effective scheduling algorithm, there are areas where further optimization and enhancements could be explored:

1. Group dependency: The efficiency of the group travel will be dependent on the trip of the first person selected.

### Conclusion 
In conclusion, despite the inherent pros and cons of the FCFS scheduling algorithm, it remains a superior choice compared to the traditional round-robin scheduling algorithm.
